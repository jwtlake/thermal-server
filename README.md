# thermal-server

## Purpuse
Server for logging and reporting on home temperature. The server project provides a RESTfull API for the [thermal-sensor](https://github.com/jwtlake/thermal-sensor) project to report to. The server also provides a dashboard UI for monitoring current temerature readings. API has already been implimented to report on historical readings but the functionality hasn't been implimented yet.

## Usage
See To Do

## To Do
- Charts that are actualy useful
- Create admin pages
- Make the ui more reactive based on screen size (tie things into the state tree a bit better)
- Write some tests for server api 
- Add Usage section to ReadMe
- Fully implement sensor key functionality (client should make a request for a server api key and server should have some way of acccepting)
- Add server side rendering of react components for initial render
- Lots more im sure...
